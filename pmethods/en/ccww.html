<p>Note that Coinbase only accepts Visa and Mastercard credit/debit cards at this time.</p> 

<p><img src="/img/coinbase/4.png" alt="coinbase" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<h2 class="bold-header">5. Confirmation</h2> 

<p>You should see a confirmation like the one below. If so, your credit/debit card has been successfully added! </p>

<h2 class="bold-header" id="coinmama-guide">CoinMama Buying Tutorial (Credit Card/Debit Card)</h2>

<h2 class="bold-header"><a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/CoinMama_Bitcoin">Open an Account</a> on CoinMama </h2> 

<p>Once you create your account and verify your email address, you can begin following the steps below:</p>

<h2 class="bold-header">1. Login to Your Account</h2> 

<p>Once you login, go to "My Account" in the top navigation bar and you should see a page like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/coinmama/1.png" alt="coinbase" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>This is the address where the bitcoins you're buying will be delivered to once your payment is confirmed. Paste your address into the empty field.</p>

<p>You'll receive a 4-digit SMS pin and an email confirmation. Once you've confirmed these forms of contact, you should see this:</p> 

<p><img src="/img/coinmama/7.png" alt="coinbase" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<h2 class="bold-header">8. Upload ID Verification</h2> 

<p><b>Most people will not need to upload a selfie. Just skip step 8 if CoinMama does not request this from you.</b></p>

<p>Upload a selfie with you holding your credit card towards the camera. Make sure your name, expiration date, and the first four and last four numbers on the card are visible.</p> 

<p><img src="/img/coinmama/8.png" alt="coinbase" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<h2 class="bold-header">9. Wait for Verification</h2> 

<p>CoinMama needs to verify that your credit card payment went through successfully.</p>

<p>Long process, yes! </p>

<p>But that's it. Wait 20-30 minutes for the bitcoins to arrive in the address you provided in step four.</p>

<h2 class="bold-header" id="bitpanda-guide">BitPanda Tutorial (Credit Card/Debit Card)</h2>

<p>This section will show you how to buy using BitPanda. (PS: you can also check out our <a href="/exchanges/bitpanda/">BitPanda review</a>!)</p>

<h2 class="bold-header"><a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/bitpanda">Open an Account</a> on BitPanda </h2> 

<p>Once you create your account and verify your email address, you can begin following the steps below:</p>

<h2 class="bold-header">Login to Your Account</h2> 

<p>Login to your account and click "Buy" in the top menu bar. You will now see a page like below. Select "Visa/Mastercard" since you want to buy with your credit or debit card. Also, enter the amount of euro you want to spend or amount of BTC you want to buy:</p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc1.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>Now confirm that you want to buy with credit/debit. (Note that only 3d-Secure Mastercard and Verfied by Visa cards are allowed. If you don't have one of these try <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/CoinMama_Bitcoin">CoinMama</a> or <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/Buy_Coinbase">Coinbase</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc2.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>Now you need to confirm that the amount you entered before is indeed the amount you want to buy. Also, you confirm that you agree to BitPanda's exchange rate. In the "the Current Price" field you can also see the exchange rate you are getting. It will likely be 3-4% above the market rate since BitPanda's fees are included in the exchange rate.</p>

<p>Note, you only have 60 seconds to lock in your exchange rate and confirm!</p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc3.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>Now you will have to verify via SMS or a phone call:</p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc4.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>Enter the PIN code you received via SMS or phone call:</p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc5.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>If you verified successfully, you can now click "Click here to start the payment process". Make sure you note the 10 minute time--you have this amount of time to complete your order.</p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc6.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>On this page you enter your credit card details through mPAY24. One you enter your card information press "Bezahlen":</p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc7.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>That's it! Now in your BitPanda account you can check your "History" tab to view the trade details. </p>

<p><img src="/img/bitpanda/cc8.png" alt="bitpanda" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>You should now <a href="/wallets/">withdraw the bitcoins you bought to your wallet</a>.</p>

<p>If you're still a bit confused, that's okay. Buying bitcoins is hard and that's why I built this site.</p><p> If you don't find an answer to your question in the section below, then post in our <a href="http://ask.buybitcoinworldwide.com/">Ask section</a> and I'll answer within 24 hours. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">What risks are involved when buying bitcoins with credit card?</h3>
<p>First of all, make sure the company you're buying for has a good reputation and is regulated. It's possible that sketchy companies selling bitcoins may be collecting card (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/credit_card_fraud">credit card fraud</a>) information and could possibly use your information to make fraud purchases with your card.</p>
<p>Some users have reported cash advanced fees, so be sure to understand how your CC company handles the purchase of bitcoins.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">What are the benefits and advantages?</h3>
<p>It can be easy to get bitcoins fast if purchasing with a debit/credit card. Since most <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/people-countries-credit-cards-americans/">people understand</a> how to shop online using credit and debit cards, it may be easier for less technical buyers to use credit cards to purchase bitcoins. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">What are the disadvantages?</h3>
<p>It's hard to buy large amounts of bitcoins with a CC or DC. Also, the fees are higher due to the risk of fraud and scams.</p>
</div>

<h2>Pro Tip</h2>
<p>Do you want to buy larger amounts of bitcoins? Try <a href="/buy-bitcoin-bank-transfer-account/">buying with a bank account</a> and you'll save on fees.</p>
</div>

<div class="row grey-row color-guide-text">
<div class="col-xs-12">

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Can I buy bitcoin with stolen credit card?</h3>
<p>This is not possible since you won't pass ID verification. It's also illegal, so you should not do it or try. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Can I buy bitcoin with credit card anonymously?</h3>
<p>This is illegal and you won't pass ID verification. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Can I buy bitcoin with a pre-paid debit card?</h3>
<p>Most exchanges will not allow you to use a pre-paid debit card. To buy bitcoin with a pre-paid debit card you will have to exchange it locally using <a href="/exchanges/localbitcoins/">LocalBitcoins</a>. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">If the limits aren't high enough for me, can I buy bitcoins on multiple exchanges?</h3>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>

<p> If, for example, CoinMama's limits are too little for you, you could buy $150 each week and also open a Coinbase account and buy an additional $150.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Why was purchasing bitcoins with a credit card once difficult?</h3>
<p>Credit card payments are reversible. Actually, merchants don't receive the money from credit card payments until ~60 days after a card is swiped.</p> 

<p>Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it's risky for a merchant to sell bitcoins for <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_To_Buy_Bitcoins_With_Your_Credit_Card">CC</a> payments. Companies have found new ways to prevent fraud and thankfully this has made it much easier to buy with a CC, as evidenced by the many options listed above.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Is it risky giving up my ID in order to buy?</h3>
<p>It depends how much you trust the exchanges. Just like any information you give up online, there is always the risk that it can be hacked or stolen from the website you give it to.</p>

<p>One thing that Bitcoin exchanges have going for them is that because they are constantly under attack, they have some of the best security and protections in place to protect against the hacking of your personal info. </p>

<p>There is always risk with anything related to information online. Even <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/yahoo-500-million-accounts-hacked-data-breach/">Yahoo was hacked</a> and information on 400 million accounts was stolen.</p>

<div class="col-xs-12">

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Should I leave my bitcoins on the exchange after I buy?</h3>
<p>We really recommend storing any bitcoins you want to keep safe in a wallet you own. Many Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and lost customer funds. If you don't want to fall victim to these hacks then the easiest way is to <a href="/wallets/">store your coins in a wallet you control</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Can you sell bitcoins?</h3>
<p>Out of the exchanges we listed, CEX.io is the only one that allows you to sell bitcoins to your credit card.</p>

<div class="nice-divider"></div>

<p>If you get one thing from this article let it be this:</p>

<p>Don't store your bitcoins on exchanges!!!</p>

<div class="quote-box">
<p>I've been buying bitcoins for more than three years. I've never lost any money to scams or thefts. Follow the guidelines in this article and you'll be able to do the same.</p>

<div class="quote-ref"><img src="/img/icons/jtsmall.jpg"><a href="https://www.jordantuwiner.com/">Jordan Tuwiner</a> <span class="position">Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide</span></div>
</div>

<p>Here are two examples where users got screwed by leaving bitcoins on exchanges:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack">Bitfinex hack where users lost $70 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">Mt Gox where users lost $450 million or more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And there are many more I could list.</p>

<p>Make sure you <a href="/wallets/">get yourself a Bitcoin wallet</a> that will securely store your bitcoins.</p>

<p>Besides storage, there are many scam exchanges out to steal your credit card information and/or bitcoins.</p>

<p>Following these two basic principles should help you avoid theft, scams, and any other loss of funds:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Do research before buying on any exchange.</b> Check reviews, ratings, and regulation information.</li>
<li><b>Don't store coins on the exchange.</b> Already mentioned above but worth repeating.</li>
</ol>
