<h2 class="chapter-name">Tutorial: Buying Bitcoin with PayPal on VirWoX</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>

<p>Here are step-by-step instructions to help make buying BTC with PayPal easier:</p>

<h2>1. <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/bitcoin_virwox" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Open an account</a> on VirWoX</h2> 

<p>From the home page, click on “Not registered yet?”</p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/1.png" alt="register VirWoX" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="enter-the-details-for-your-account">2. Enter the details for your account</h2> 

<p>Now you’ll enter your details in order to create an account. Don’t get confused by the section titled “Link to avatar”. You can leave this untouched. </p> <p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/2.png" alt="create account virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="check-your-email">3. Check your email</h2> 

<p>At this point, your account has been created. A temporary password will be emailed to the address you provided in step two. </p> 

<p><strong>This password is temporary and MUST be changed. If you don’t change this password within 24 hours your account will be deleted. We show you how to change your password in the next step.</strong></p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/3.png" alt="check email virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="change-your-password">4. Change your password</h2> 

<p>Once you login with your temporary password, click on “Change settings” in the left sidebar. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/4.png" alt="change password virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> <h2 id="create-a-new-password">5. Create a new password</h2> 

<p>Enter a new password. Make sure you choose a strong password, since you're dealing with money! </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/5.png" alt="create password virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="deposit-from-paypal">6. Deposit from PayPal</h2> 

<p>Once you’ve changed your password, click on “Deposit” in the left sidebar. </p> <p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/6.png" alt="deposit from paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="deposit-and-select-amount">7. Deposit and select amount</h2> 

<p>Scroll down a bit to find the option to deposit with PayPal. Enter the amount you want to deposit on the left and then click the “Checkout with PayPal” button. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/7.png" alt="change paypal for sll" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> <h2 id="login-to-paypal">8. Login to PayPal</h2> 

<p>Sign in to PayPal. Note on the left side that I'm depositing $2. This is the amount I chose back in step 7. If this amount is not what you chose, go back and enter a new amount. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/8.png" alt="login to paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="verify-acccount-balance">9. Verify account balance</h2> 

<p>If you followed PayPal’s directions successfully, you should now see a balance in your VirWoX account. Note that the amount displayed in your VirWoX account may be slightly less than the amount you entered in step 7. This is because PayPal charges a 2.9% + $0.30 fee per deposit. </p> 

<p>After this, click on “USD/SLL”. If you deposited with Euro then click “EUR/SLL”. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/9.png" alt="check balance" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="trade-usd-for-second-life-lindens">10. Trade USD for Second Life Lindens</h2> 

<p>Remember how we said you’ll have to buy Second Life Lindens and then trade those for bitcoins? Well, now we’re buying the SLL. In this step you need to sell the USD you deposited from PayPal and get SLL. </p> 

<p>Enter the amount of USD you want to sell. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/10.png" alt="trade sll for usd" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="complete-order">11. Complete order</h2> 

<p>You can see in the top left of the image below that I now have a balance in SLL. If you now have SLL, that means everything has gone well. </p> 

<p>Now click on “BTC/SLL” in the left sidebar. Now we’re going to exchange our SLL for bitcoin. </p> <p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/11.png" alt="exchange" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="trade-sll-for-btc">12. Trade SLL for BTC</h2> 

<p>The process is the same here. Simply enter the amount of BTC you want to buy and click “Next”. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/12.png" alt="paypal to bitcoin" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="buy-bitcoin">13. Buy bitcoin!</h2> 

<p>That’s it! You should now see your balance in BTC displayed in the top left of the screen. You’ve successfully bought bitcoin with PayPal. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/13.png" alt="buy bitcoin" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Is using VirWoX really the fastest and best way to buy bitcoins via PayPal?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, yes:</p>

<p>PayPal bans its users from selling bitcoins for PayPal funds.</p> 

<p>Even if sellers were allowed to accept PayPal for bitcoins, the risk of fraud and chargebacks would be too large and premiums/fees would likely be higher than VirWoX.</p>

<p>One way that may be better is if you are able to find a local dealer at a Bitcoin meetup. If someone you trust is willing to sell you bitcoins directly for PayPal, this a good option.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">What is Paxful?</h3>
<p>Paxful is a LocalBitcoins type service that also allows people to buy bitcoin with PayPal. We don't list it here, though, since VirWoX is the main method we can recommend for now.</p>

<p>I've been buying bitcoins for more than three years. I've never lost any money to scams or thefts. Follow the guidelines in this article and you'll be able to do the same.</p>

<p>And there are many more I could list.</p>

<p>Make sure you <a href="/wallets/">get yourself a Bitcoin wallet</a> that will securely store your bitcoins.</p>

<p>Besides storage, there are many scam exchanges out to steal your credit card information and/or bitcoins.</p>

<p>Following these two basic principles should help you avoid theft, scams, and any other loss of funds:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Do research before buying on any exchange.</b> Check reviews, ratings, and regulation information.</li>
<li><b>Don't store coins on the exchange.</b> Already mentioned above but worth repeating.</li>

<h2 class="chapter-name">How to Buy Bitcoin with PayPal on LocalBitcoins</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>

<p>We don't recommend buying bitcoins with PayPal on LocalBitcoins. The prices are much higher than VirWoX and the limits usually lower.</p>

<p>With LocalBitcoins, the fees are even worse as the premium is about 20% compared to the global Bitcoin exchange rate. Plus another 1% charged by LocalBitcoins! </p> 

<p>Another difference is with LocalBitcoins you are dealing with an individual seller rather than a marketplace. You will also need a verified phone number connected to your LocalBitcoins account.</p>

<p>To start, login to LocalBitcoins and then enter your buy amount and PayPal as the payment method:</p>

<p><img src="/img/lbpaypal/1.png" alt="buy bitcoin on localbitcoins using paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<p>You should now see a list of sellers willing to accept PayPal. Note that when I wrote this guide, the price of Bitcoin was $1,000 so the prices are mostly even more than 20% above the market rate!</p>

<p><img src="/img/lbpaypal/2.png" alt="buy bitcoin on localbitcoins using paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<p>Click on one of the sellers and you'll see a page like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/lbpaypal/3.png" alt="buy bitcoin on localbitcoins using paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<p>In the example above, you can see the buyer's limits on the left side (25-100 USD). On the right, the buyer has laid a number of rules and requirements for your PayPal account. This buyer, for example, requires that you send a picture of your photo ID, have a verified PayPal account, and also send a selfie holding your ID. VirWoX does not have any of these requirements. Also, most sellers on LocalBitcoins do not sell to residents of New York.</p>

<p>Note, you can also check a seller's feedback and history. Click on the username on the right side and a new tab will show that looks like this: </p>

<p><img src="/img/lbpaypal/4.png" alt="buy bitcoin on localbitcoins using paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<p>This seller has 3,000+ confirmed trades so your transaction would likely go through smoothly. If a seller has no feedback/history, this is a huge red flag! </p>

<p>If you had a verified account then on the left side you would be able to enter how much you want to buy and go through with your trade!</p>
