CEX.IO offers four different account levels based on verification provided. Each account type has different buying limits.

**Individual Business & Corporate**: Individual Business and Corporate accounts can purchase an unlimited amount of bitcoins. 

## Privacy
CEX.IO requires very little information for its first tier of verification. In order to increase limits, however, a number of personal details and document scans are required. 

To increase your daily limits to CEX.IO's "Verified" level, scans of a passport, driver's license, or ID are required. In addition, a picture of you holding your ID, a picture holding your credit card, and a document for proof of residency are required. 

## Speed
After initial verification, CEX.IO processes most credit card purchases instantly. Upgrading your account to CEX.IO's "Verified" account type can be a long process, but subsequent purchases are quick. 

## Reputation
CEX.IO is a registered company and/or money transmitter in all districts in which it operates. In the USA, it is registered with FinCEN, and registered with ICO in the UK and EU. 

## Fees
Fees for buying with a credit card are 3.9% + $0.25 per purchase. Purchases made via bank transfer are free.
