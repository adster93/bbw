<h2 id="gemini">Gemini Review</h2>
<p><a href="https://gemini.com/">Gemini</a> is a Bitcoin exchange run by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winklevoss_twins">Winklevoss twins</a>.</p>

<p>It's a licensed Bitcoin exchange and operates in 42 US states and many other countries (check <a href="https://gemini.com/areas-of-operation/">here for full list</a> of supported districts): </p>

<p><img style="max-width: 700px !important;" class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="gemini review" src="/img/kb/gemini.png"></p>

<p>Once you create an account on the exchange you will need to setup 2-factor authentication, verify your bank account, and verify your identity. Once you do all of that you can get started with the exchange.</p>

<p>Gemini's interface can be confusing for first time buyers, which is why we usually recommend <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/Buy_Coinbase">Coinbase</a> to new buyers. Have a look at the trading interface below:</p>

<p><img style="max-width: 700px !important;" class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="gemini review" src="/img/kb/gemini2.png"></p>

<p>If you can get past understanding how to use Gemini it is a unique exchange. Some of its great features include:</p>
                                   
<h3>Instant Deposit for ACH Transfers</h3>
<p>At most exchanges, when you <a href="/buy-bitcoin-bank-transfer-account/">deposit via bank transfer</a> you have to wait 1-7 days for the bank transfer to complete. Gemini understands this is frustrating and time consuming.</p>

<p>Luckily for US users, you can make instant ACH deposits to Gemini. This means you can buy bitcoins super fast. You will have the bitcoins you bought locked into your account until your ACH deposit clears, but at least this way you were able to buy bitcoin fast and lock in the price you wanted!</p>
