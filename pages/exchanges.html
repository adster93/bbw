<h2>More Exchange Reviews</h2>
<p>While we don't have a dedicated page for every exchange, the section below will give you more details on other popular exchanges</p>

<h2 id="gemini">Gemini Review</h2>
<p><a href="https://gemini.com/">Gemini</a> is a Bitcoin exchange run by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winklevoss_twins">Winklevoss twins</a>.</p>

<p>It's a licensed Bitcoin exchange and operates in 42 US states and many other countries (check <a href="https://gemini.com/areas-of-operation/">here for full list</a> of supported districts): </p>

<p><img style="max-width: 700px !important;" class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="gemini review" src="/img/kb/gemini.png"></p>

<p>Once you create an account on the exchange you will need to setup 2-factor authentication, verify your bank account, and verify your identity. Once you do all of that you can get started with the exchange.</p>

<p>Gemini's interface can be confusing for first time buyers, which is why we usually recommend <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/Buy_Coinbase">Coinbase</a> to new buyers. Have a look at the trading interface below:</p>

<p><img style="max-width: 700px !important;" class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="gemini review" src="/img/kb/gemini2.png"></p>

<p>If you can get past understanding how to use Gemini it is a unique exchange. Some of its great features include:</p>
                                   
<h3>Instant Deposit for ACH Transfers</h3>
<p>At most exchanges, when you <a href="/buy-bitcoin-bank-transfer-account/">deposit via bank transfer</a> you have to wait 1-7 days for the bank transfer to complete. Gemini understands this is frustrating and time consuming.</p>

<p>Luckily for US users, you can make instant ACH deposits to Gemini. This means you can buy bitcoins super fast. You will have the bitcoins you bought locked into your account until your ACH deposit clears, but at least this way you were able to buy bitcoin fast and lock in the price you wanted!</p>

<h2 id="kraken">Kraken Review</h2>

<p><img src="/img/large/kraken.png" alt="kraken" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>If you live in Europe, don't worry! </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a> is a global Bitcoin exchange and supports European residents along with residents of the <a href="/united-states/">United States</a>, <a href="/canada/">Canada</a>, and <a href="/japan/">Japan</a>.</p>

<p>Kraken offers excellent liquidity as its average daily volume is around 10-12 million euros. So if you want to <a href="/kb/buy-large-amounts-of-bitcoin/">buy large amounts of bitcoins</a>, Kraken is a good option.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>Like all regulated exchanges, you will have to verify your identity and personal details before buying.</p>

<p>Here are Kraken's limits based on your verification level:</p>

<p><img src="/img/kb/krakenlimits.png" alt="kraken review" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>So in order to deposit money and buy bitcoins, you will need to verify your:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Full name</li>
 <li>Date of birth</li>
 <li>Country of residence</li>
 <li>Phone number</li>
 <li>Address verification</li>
</ul>

<p>There are further verification levels, but most people will only need Tier 2 to buy bitcoins.</p> 

<h3>User and Trading Interface</h3>

<p>Like other exchanges geared towards traders, its interface can be quite confusing. Kraken, however, has aimed to make things easier for first-time buyers and its "Simple" order form is pretty easy to use:</p>

<p><img style="max-width: 700px !important;" class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="kraken review" src="/img/kb/ksimple.png"></p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kraken.com/help/fees">Kraken's fees</a> are quite confusing. So to keep it simple we will summarize: </p>

<p>If you are buying less than $50,000 of bitcoins per month expect to pay between 0.16-0.26% in fees per buy.</p>

<p>If you use the "Simple" order form is displayed above you will pay 0.26%. If you want to learn how to use Kraken's advanced order types you can pay just 0.16% if you become a "market maker".</p>

<h2 id="bitstamp">Bitstamp Review</h2>

<p><img src="/img/large/bitstamp.png" alt="bitstamp" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/">Bitstamp</a> is one of the longer running Bitcoin exchanges. It has been around since 2011 and is a <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/payment-institution-license/">licensed exchange</a> with the Luxembourg's Ministry of Finance</a>

<p>It is a good option for traders and those buying large amounts of bitcoins.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<p><img class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="bitstamp review" src="/img/kb/stampv.png"></p>

<p>Bitstamp requires extensive verification including the following information:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Full name</li>
 <li>Date of birth</li>
 <li>Country of residence</li>
 <li>Phone number</li>
 <li>Address verification</li>
 <li>ID number and scan of photo ID document</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>Because Bitstamp is geared towards traders, it also has <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/fee_schedule/">confusing fees</a> if you use the exchange. The fees you pay depend on your total volume. Unless you trade high volumes, you will likely pay 0.25% per buy. </p>

<p>If you buy bitcoins on Bitstamp with your credit card then the fees will be 8% for purchases up to $500 or â‚¬500. There are other exchanges that offer lower fees for <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/en/buy-bitcoin-credit-debit-card/">buying bitcoins with a credit card or debit card</a>. </p>

<h2 id="bitfinex-review">Bitfinex Review</h2>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://buybitcoinww.co/bitfinex_exchange">Bitfinex</a> is a popular exchange because in terms of USD trading volume it has the most liquidity. It currently owns about a 10% share of the USD trading market.</p>

<p>Because of its confusing interface, it's probably only a good choice for traders who really know what they are doing. Here is what the main trading interface looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/img/kb/bitfinex.png" alt="bitfinex review" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<p>Despite getting hacked and losing $70 million or more in customer funds, Bitfinex remains a popular option for serious traders. Still, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-hack-still-scaring-bitcoin-traders/">the hack is scaring</a> <i>some</i> people away.</p>

<p>In the chart below, the orange portion of the bars represent Bitfinex's share of USD volume:</p>

<p><img src="/img/kb/finexshare.png" alt="bitfinex share" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>One thing that has made Bitfinex popular is that if you only make a deposit with cryptocurrency <a href="/kb/buy-bitcoin-without-verification-id/">no verification is required</a>. If you want to deposit dollars or euro then you WILL have to verify your ID.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>Btifinex offers very low fees even for low volume buyers, at 0.1% per buy for market makers and 0.2% per buy for market takers.</p>
