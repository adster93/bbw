<h2 class="chapter-name">Choosing an Exchange: Which is the Best Bitcoin Exchange?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>

<p>To select the perfect exchange for your needs, consider these 7 factors. </p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">1. Privacy: Keep Your Information Safe!</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>Want to buy bitcoins privately?</p> 

<p>You can already cross off a number of payment methods: </p>

<ul>
<li>Bank transfer</li>
<li>Credit card</li> 
<li>Debit card</li>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Any other method that requires personally or identifying information</li>
</ul> 

<p><a href="/en/buy-bitcoins-with-cash/">Buying bitcoins with cash or cash deposit</a> is the most private way to buy bitcoins.</p>

<p>We also have a detailed guide which reveals your <a href="/kb/buy-bitcoin-without-verification-id/">options for buying without verification or ID</a>.</p> 

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">2. Limits: Are You Buying a Lot of Coins?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p> If you need to buy a large amount of bitcoins--say 25 or more--then big brokers or major exchanges are the way to go.</p>

<p><a href="/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> has high limits for buying with a bank account. </p>

<div class="wide-img">
<img class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="coin atm radar" src="/img/coinbase/cblimits.png">
<div class="wide-img-caption">Coinbase's buying limits. They vary for credit card and bank transfer.</div>
</div>

<p><a href="/exchanges/coinmama/">CoinMama</a> has the highest limits for buying with a credit card.</p> 

<p>Most cash exchanges have no buying limits. Limits, however, will vary between individual sellers and are usually lower than online exchanges.</p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">3. Speed: When Do You Need Access to your Bitcoins?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>How quickly do you need to convert regular money into bitcoins? Different payment methods deliver your coins at different speeds.</p>

<div class="quote-box">
<p>Your first Bitcoin purchase may be time consuming. Once you get everything setup all subsequent purchases will be much faster! </p>
<div class="quote-ref"><img src="/img/icons/jtsmall.jpg"><a href="https://www.jordantuwiner.com/">Jordan Tuwiner</a> <span class="position">Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide</span></div>
</div>

<p>Bitcoin ATMs can be the fastest way to purchase bitcoin if you’re lucky enough to have one in your area. <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/">Here's a map</a> to help you out.</p>

<p>Some brokers offer instant buys with bank transfer, credit card, or debit card. </p> 

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">4. Exchange Rate</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>There is no official Bitcoin price. Use <a href="http://bitcoinaverage.com/">BitcoinAverage</a> or <a href="http://coindesk.com/price">CoinDesk</a> to see the average price of Bitcoin across all major international Bitcoin exchanges and compare that to the price on your chosen exchange. </p> 

<div class="wide-img">
<img class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="coin atm radar" src="/img/kb/bpi.png">
<div class="wide-img-caption">The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index averages the price across multiple exchanges to create a strong reference point.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">5. Reputation: Don't Get Scammed!</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>How long has the exchange been in service? Is the exchange trustworthy? Our <a href="/exchanges/">Bitcoin exchange reviews</a> can help you to find a trusted exchange. </p> 

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">6. Fees: Are You Getting a Good Deal?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>How much does the exchange charge for its services? The fee will vary greatly based on the payment method you choose to use.</p>

<p>Remember to include deposit and withdrawal fees as well as trading fees. Some exchanges will lower their fees if you trade a lot of bitcoins.</p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">7. Payment Method</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>How can you pay for the bitcoins? Payment method may be the most important factor.</p>

<p>In fact: </p>

<p>We're sure you already have a payment method in mind that you'd prefer to use. More on that below.</p>

<h2>Where to Buy Bitcoin?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Purchase bitcoins online with a credit card, debit card, or bank transfer.</li>
	<li>Acquire bitcoins from a Bitcoin ATM near you.</li>
	<li>Buy bitcoins with cash locally or via cash deposit.</li>
	<li>Convert PayPal to Bitcoin online.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above was just a brief overview of where you can buy bitcoin. Now, let's get into the details.</p>

<p>In order to buy bitcoins, you’ll need to exchange your local currency, like Dollars or Euros, for bitcoin. Here’s an overview of the 4 most common payment methods: </p> 

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">1. Credit or Debit Card</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p><img class="color-guide-img halfimg-right" alt="best bitcoin wallet" src="/img/goodicons/exchange.png">Credit/debit cards are the most common way to pay online. So, it's really no surprise that many people want to buy bitcoins this way.</p>

<h3>Why buy bitcoin with a credit/debit card?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-pros">
	<li>Credit cards are a payment method most people are familiar with; probably the easiest way to buy bitcoins online</li>
	<li>Delivery of bitcoins is instant once initial verification is complete</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why NOT buy bitcoin with a credit/debit card?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-cons">
	<li>High fees; if you're patient and not in a rush to buy then use a bank transfer for lower fees</li>
	<li>Not a private way to buy; your ID will be required to buy with a credit card</li>
</ul> 

<p>A few places to buy bitcoins online with a credit card are: </p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a></b> - USA, Canada, Singapore, and Europe</li>
<li><b><a href="/exchanges/coinmama/">Coinmama</a></b> - Global</li>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Bank Account or Bank Transfer</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p><img class="color-guide-img halfimg-right" alt="best bitcoin wallet" src="/img/goodicons/piggy.png"> Bank transfer is one of best ways to buy bitcoins in most countries.</p> 

<h3>Why buy bitcoins with bank account/transfer?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-pros">
	<li>Good way to <a href="/kb/buy-large-amounts-of-bitcoin/">buy large amounts of bitcoins</a></li>
	<li>Using a bank transfer will usually result in the lowest fees, so you can get a great price on your purchase</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why not to buy bitcoins with bank account/transfer?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-cons">
	<li>Usually requires ID verification, so not a good choice for privacy</li>
    <li>Slow; in the USA, bank transfers can take up to 5 days to complete</li>
</ul> 

<p>Some of the best ways to buy bitcoins with your bank account: </p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a></b> - USA, Canada, Singapore, and Europe</li>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Cash</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p><img class="color-guide-img halfimg-right" alt="best bitcoin wallet" src="/img/goodicons/cash.png">Cash deposit is often the fastest and most private ways to buy bitcoin. You can usually receive your bitcoins within a couple hours.</p>

<h3>What are cash exchanges <b>good</b> for?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-pros">
	<li>Can be more private since in some cases no personal information is required</li>
	<li>Can be nearly instant; no need to wait 5 days for a bank transfer to process</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are cash exchanges <b>bad</b> for?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-cons">
	<li>Privacy comes at a cost; cash exchanges often have price 5-15% above market rate</li>
	<li>Easier to get scammed or robbed; need to be on alert and follow the exchange's rules</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: There is no easy way to buy bitcoin at Walmart. We get asked this A LOT!</p>

<p>There are Bitcoin ATMs all around the world that let you purchase bitcoin with cash.</p>

<p>You simply insert cash into the machine, and get bitcoins sent to your wallet. </p>

<h3>What are Bitcoin ATMs <b>good</b> for?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-pros">
	<li>Can be more private since in most cases no personal information is required</li>
	<li>If you have an ATM in your area it can be a convenient and fast way to buy coins</li>

<h3>What are Bitcoin ATMs <b>bad</b> for?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-cons">
	<li>Privacy comes at a cost; Bitcoin ATMs often have a 5-15% premium above market rate</li>
</ul> 

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">PayPal</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p> There is no way to directly <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/07/buttonwood/">buy bitcoins</a> with PayPal. Under PayPal’s terms and conditions merchants are not allowed to sell bitcoins for PayPal.</p> 

<div class="quote-box">
<p>I really recommend not buying bitcoins with PayPal. The fees are really high. Chances are that your PayPal is connected to your credit card or bank account, which can be used to buy at much lower fees.</p>
<div class="quote-ref"><img src="/img/icons/jtsmall.jpg"><a href="https://www.jordantuwiner.com/">Jordan Tuwiner</a> <span class="position">Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide</span></div>
</div>

<p>However, there are a few hacks to get around this. You can buy other digital items with PayPal and sell those items for bitcoin. It's all explained in our <a href="/en/buy-bitcoin-paypal/">guide on how to buy bitcoins with PayPal</a>. </p>

<h3>Why buy bitcoins with PayPal?</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-pros">
	<li>If you already have a balance, it can be an easy and fast way to convert PayPal to bitcoins</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons of buying bitcoins with PayPal</h3>
<ul class="quick-info-cons">
	<li>Fees are over 12%; much better to just buy with a credit card or bank account</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">When is the Right Time to Buy?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>As with any market, nothing is for sure. Bitcoin is traded 24/7 and its price changes every second.</p> 

<div class="wide-img">
<img class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="coin atm radar" src="/img/kb/chart.png">
<div class="wide-img-caption">Bitcoin's price in US dollars during 2015 and 2016. It's impossible to say when to buy.</div>
</div>

<p>Use tools like <a href="https://bitcoinwisdom.com/">Bitcoin Wisdom</a> or <a href="https://cryptowat.ch/">Cryptowatch</a> to analyze charts from other Bitcoin trading sites. These charts will help you understand Bitcoin’s price history across the many global Bitcoin exchanges.</p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Why Does Buying Bitcoin Take So Long?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>Long wait times are usually a problem with existing payment systems, not with Bitcoin itself.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions only take about 10 minutes to confirm. Bank transfers in the U.S., for example, can take up to five days to complete.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions can be confirmed as quickly as 10 minutes; it’s rare to experience a delay longer than one hour.</p>

<p>This means that a merchant can’t release bitcoins to a customer until five days have passed unless they're willing to take on risk.</p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Can You Sell Bitcoins?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>Yes, of course! Most exchanges that let you buy bitcoins also let you sell (for a fee of course).</p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Why Do I Need to Upload my ID for Some Exchanges?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<p>This is due to <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) laws which require exchanges to record the real world identity of their clients.</p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Can Anyone Buy Bitcoin?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>Bitcoin requires no permission to use or buy.</p>
<p>You will have to check the legality of Bitcoin in your country. In <a href="http://money.cnn.com/interactive/technology/where-is-bitcoin-legal/">most countries Bitcoin is legal</a>!</p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Should I Buy Physical Bitcoins?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>

<div class="wide-img">
<img class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="coin atm radar" src="/img/kb/physical.jpg">
<div class="wide-img-caption">A physical bitcoin for sale. <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/">Source</a></div>
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/10-physical-bitcoins-good-bad-ugly/">Physical bitcoins</a> are physical, metal coins with a Bitcoin private key embedded inside. </p>

<p>We recommend that you stay away from physical bitcoins unless you’re a numismatist.</p>

<p>While physical coins sound like a good idea, they force you to trust the honesty of creator of their creator. The creator could create two copies of the private key. </p>

<p>Unless you immediately open and withdraw the digital bitcoins from your physical bitcoin, the creator could at any time steal the funds it contains. </p>

<h2 class="wallet-type-hot">Can I Buy Partial Bitcoins?</h2>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>Yes, of course!</p>

<p>Each bitcoin is divisible to the 8th decimal place, meaning each bitcoin can be split into 100,000,000 pieces. Each unit of bitcoin, or 0.00000001 bitcoin, is called a satoshi.</p>

<p>Most exchanges let you buy as little as $5 worth of bitcoins at a time.</p>

<p>There are many scams related to Bitcoin. Scammers target new Bitcoiners and less tech-savvy users. Follow these basic rules in order to avoid Bitcoin scams:</p>

<h3><b>Research</b></h3>
<p>Study your intended exchange and make sure it’s trustworthy. Search forums like Reddit for the experiences of other users.

<p> You can also use <a href="/exchanges/">our Bitcoin exchange reviews to get in depth information</a> about certain exchanges. If you don’t find your intended exchange listed on this site, extra caution and research is advised as it may be a scam!</p>

<h3><b>Check Ratings</b></h3> 
<p>If you’re using a peer-to-peer exchange like LocalBitcoins or Wall of Coins, check the seller’s feedback. If most of their feedback is positive, your trade is more likely to go through without issues. If a seller has lots of negative feedback, it’s best to simply stay away and find a more reliable seller.</p>

<h3><b>Use Escrow</b></h3> 
<p>Many scammers will try an approach like this:</p>

<p>“Send me bitcoins, and once I get the bitcoins I’ll pay you on PayPal!” </p>

<p>Don’t ever agree to a trade like this. Bitcoin payments are irreversible, so if you send first the scammer can simply not pay you and keep their bitcoins. </p>

<p>PayPal can't force the scammer to pay either, due to the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin which doesn’t record the identity of a payment’s sender or recipient. This would leave you with no way to get your bitcoins back. </p>

<h3><b>Stay Away from Bitcoin investments</b></h3> 
<p>Any service that claims to pay interest on bitcoins or increase your bitcoins is likely extremely risky or an outright scam. If it sounds too good to be true, stay away.</p>

<h3><b>Be Careful with Altcoins</b></h3>
<p>What are altcoins? Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Altcoins are traded globally on hundreds of exchanges. Avoid throwing money into coins which are experiencing a sudden and dramatic spike in price and volume. Such moves, especially in insignificant coins with otherwise thin volume and flat price action, are likely to crash fast. </p>

<p>Don't store coins on exchanges! Bitcoin users have lost over $1 billion worth of bitcoins in exchange hacks and scams. </p>

<p>Your bitcoins are only safe if you <a href="/wallets/">store them in a wallet that is controlled by YOU!</a></p>

<p>Here are two examples where users got screwed by leaving bitcoins with a third party:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack">Bitfinex hack where users lost $70 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">Mt Gox where users lost $450 million or more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, do yourself a favor:</p>

<p>Get yourself a Bitcoin wallet and control your own coins. For large amounts of <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-Bitcoins">bitcoins</a>, we recommend hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are small, offline devices that store your bitcoins offline and out of reach from hackers and malware.</p>


<h2>Why? It's pretty simple:</h2>
<ul class="quick-info-pros">
	<li>Hardware wallets are the easiest way to securely store bitcoins and easy to backup</li>
	<li>Less margin for error; setup is easy even for less technical users</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Check out the hardware wallet comparison chart below:</p>

<table class="hw-comparison">
  <tr>
  	<th></th>
    <th>Wallet</th>
    <th>Screen<br></th>
    <th class="released">Released</th>
    <th>Price</th>
    <th class="wallet-buy">Buy</th>
  </tr>
  {% assign pages = site.wallets | sort:"weight" %}
  {% for wallet in pages reversed %}
  {% if wallet.tags contains 'hardware' %}
  {% include hw-comparison.html %}
  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
