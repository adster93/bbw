For a while, the [TREZOR](/wallets/trezor/) was the only hardware wallet on the market. Now, [KeepKey](/wallets/keepkey/) and the [Ledger Nano S](/wallets/ledger-nano-s/) have been released and have created great competition in the hardware wallet market. Not only has the competition lowered prices, but it makes choosing the right hardware wallet a tough decision. 

This comparison will show you which wallet is better in different categories for TREZOR vs. KeepKey vs. Ledger Nano S.

## Price

The Ledger Nano S is the cheapest wallet of the three by far.

## Screen

For a while, the TREZOR was the only hardware wallet with a screen. Since a screen is such an important security feature for a hardware wallet it was clear that more would be created.

## Security 

All three wallets are very similar in the way that they handle security. 

The main difference is that the Ledger Nano S uses two secure elements/chips, while the TREZOR and KeepKey are essentially small computers. 

All three devices have screens which means they can be securely setup and used even on computers infected with malware. 

## Setup 

All three wallets are very easy to setup and require a micro USB cable to use. 

I have been able to set up all three in just a couple of minutes. All three wallets require very similar steps to setup, like writing down a backup of your recovery seed and setting a PIN code. 

## Size & Design

![trezor vs. ledger nano s vs. keepkey ](/img/wallets/tlk.jpg){: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

As seen in the image above, the TREZOR is by far the smallest of the three devices. Each wallet does have some unique differences that are hard to see in the picture. Also note that the Nano S can be folded into about the same size as the TREZOR, but to use it you must unfold it. 

The TREZOR and Ledger Nano S both have two physical buttons, while the KeepKey has one. 

The KeepKey's screen is much bigger than the other two wallets. As mentioned earlier, the KeepKey's larger screen means it can be securely recovered using a cipher which leaks less data.

The TREZOR is made out of plastic, while the Ledger Nano S and KeepKey are made out of aluminum. Although aluminum sounds like it's nicer, the TREZOR's plastic can actually prove to be more drop resistant. 

## Software Compatibility

In order to use any hardware wallet you need software that helps you command and interact with the wallet. The table below shows the compatibiltiy of Bitcoin wallet software with each hardware wallet.
